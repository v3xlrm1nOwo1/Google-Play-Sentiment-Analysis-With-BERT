## Google Play Sentiment Analysis With BERT

### Model 

For this project I am using 'bert-base-cased'.
It's pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. It was introduced in <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805'>the paper</a> and first released in this repository. <a href='https://github.com/google-research/bert'>The model</a> is case-sensitive: it makes a difference between english and English.


### Why 'bert-base-cased'? 

Because in a task like sentiment analysis, people usually write words with a capital letter when they are angry or when they hate or like something.

### Note

I did not have the resources, such as the Internet, electricity, device, etc., to train the model well and choose the appropriate learning rate, so there were no results
