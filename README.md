## Google Play Sentiment Analysis With BERT

### Model 

For this project I am using 'bert-base-cased'.

### Why 'bert-base-cased'? 

Because in a task like sentiment analysis, people usually write words with a capital letter when they are angry or when they hate or like something.

### Dataset

This project uses reviews from 33 applications, the max length being determined by the longest review


### Note

I did not have the resources, such as the Internet, electricity, device, etc., to train the model well and choose the appropriate learning rate, so there were no results
